# DSS-Builder

Distributed State Space Builder is a distributed verification implementation based on modular Petri nets. It allows to build a distributed state space instead of the flat state space. A property that concerns one module can be checked by only exploring the graph that is associated with one module.






## Building


- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/cabid/DistributedStateSpace.git

- `mkdir build`

- `cd build`
